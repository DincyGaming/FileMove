# FileMove
moves files

To use you must have a target folder and a source folder(they can have any name, just need the path to them). The script is then placed in the source folder along with whatever files need sorted out into other folders.  make sure the folder you have set as your destination has a sub folder with the same name as the word you are trying to match.
